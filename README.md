# Portfolio in Angular

This is my portfolio created with angular2, just for train and fun!

This project was made with [**Angular-CLI**](https://cli.angular.io/), make sure you have [**Angular-CLI**](https://cli.angular.io/) installed,
> After clone *'use'* **npm install** **<`npm i`>** to download all the node packages.
>> Then *'use'* **<`ng serve`>** to build the project. 
>> The server runs in **http://localhost:4200**

## What I've used:

3. Font: ['Source Sans Pro'](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro), from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
